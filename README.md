# Kingdomhire v2
This is the repository for the new Kingdomhire v2 website
I thought it was a good time to re-visit www.kingdomhire.co.uk and improve the site

Planned improvements:

* __The Administrator Dashboard__

   A new admin site, where an admin can access a dashboard that allows them to directly query the database.  
   The admin can generate specific reports based on the database, such as *list of vehicles currently out for hire*,  
   or *List of all current reservations* etc.  
   More features will be included, such as a facility to add new vehicles into the database, which will in turn display
   the new vehicle on the website  
   
* __More vehicles displayed on website, with search and sort functionality__

   More vehicles will be added to the **Vehicles Page**. The vehicles will be displayed in a catalog-like format,  
   where the user can search and sort through the vehicles, such as sort by vehicle type, number of seats etc.
   
* __More important business info to be included on the website__

   Just some more additional business info, such as opening hours, vehicle price ranges and details about how to reserve a vehicle etc.


I am using *Laravel 5.5* to aid in the development process
