# Kingdomhire-2.0
This is the repository for the new Kingdomhire-2.0 website  
I thought it was a good time to re-visit www.kingdomhire.co.uk and improve the site

I am using *Laravel 5.6* to aid in the development process  
I will be using a *MySQL* database backend for the new website  
The application needs to be compatible with *MySQL 5.5*, due to the web host only supporting it

# New Features
### The Administrator Dashboard
  A new admin dashboard, where an admin can access a dashboard that allows them to directly query the database.  
  The purpose of the dashboard is allow an admin to be able to manage __vehicles__, __hires__ and __reservations__
   
### Website Front-end Update 
   More important business info will need to be displayed on the website, along with a more complete list of vehicles
